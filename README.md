# Snake-Game
The objective of this project is to develop a classic Snake Game using C# in a console-based environment. The game allows the player to navigate a snake to eat randomly placed food items within a specified grid, which increases both the snake’s length and the player’s score. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundary walls or itself.
